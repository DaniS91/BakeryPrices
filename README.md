## Description

_Thisis a simple console app in C#; the project was created to practice Test-Driven Development in C# and .NET, as part of a course at Epicodus. The application calculates an order total for two possible categories of items: bread and pastries. It uses two classes with static methods to apply separate promotional pricing to each category. The bread items receive a "Buy 2 get 1 free" deal, and the pastries receive a "Buy 3 get 1 free" deal. A separate "Customer Order" class is used to calculate the order total which is then displayed to the customer._
